Now, let's list 10 more things we need to add to the toolkit:

1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline setup scripts
2. Docker containerization utilities
3. Database management tools (e.g., backup, restore, migration scripts)
4. API testing and documentation generation tools
5. Log analysis and visualization utilities
5. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools
7. Performance profiling and optimization utilities
8. Version control helpers (e.g., git hooks, branch management scripts)
9. Cloud service integration tools (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure CLI wrappers)
10. Automated code review and style checking tools

Now, let's update the existing files to reflect these additions:

1. Update `setup_devtoolkit.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# ... (existing code) ...

# Install additional tools
echo "Installing additional development tools..."
pip install jupyter black flake8 mypy pytest coverage docker-compose awscli

# Install system dependencies for new tools
if command_exists apt-get; then
    echo "Installing system dependencies..."
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y docker.io jq
fi

# ... (rest of the existing code) ...
